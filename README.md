## Selection Sort

- Time Complexity : O(n `<sup>2</sup>`)
- Comparisions : O(n `<sup>2</sup>`)
- Swaps : O(n)

> Important Notes:
>
> - Selection Sort takes the least number of swaps compared to other algorithms
> - Selection Sort is not a stable algorithm
> - Selection Sort algorithm is not in place
